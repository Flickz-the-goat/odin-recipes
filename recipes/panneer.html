        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>We'd ask my mom to make pooris and shahi paneer for dinner whenever our parents went out. My mom always obliged, making us these rich, vegetarian paneer cubes in a tomato-cream sauce. Here's the recipe!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbps cooking oil</li>
            <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder</li>
            <li>4 tomatoes, pureed</li>
            <li>1/2 pound paneer, cubed</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chooped fresh cilantro</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook onion and garlic until onions are soft and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle cumin, coriander, turmeric, and chili powder over onion and garlic. Continue cooking until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
                
            </li>
            <li>Add pureed tomatoes to the skillet. Cook until excess liquid evaporates and oil separates, 3 to 5 minutes. Add paneer, water, sugar, and salt. Stir gently so paneer does not break apart. Cook until paneer absorbs some liquid, about 10 minutes. Stir in cream and simmer another 5 minutes. Garnish with cilantro to serve.</li>
        
        </ol>
